DATA CHALLENGE
- 

This repository has 2 years worth of Lending Club loan files stored in the data/ directory. 
These files are quarterly, and have data on loans that Lending Club has 
issued (date, amount, term, interest rate), metadata about the customer who took them 
out (such as employment, annual income, FICO), and the loan status. There is a data dictionary stored
in the docs/ directory.

Goal: build a model that predicts a new loan's probability of default, using the data provided.
